# Video Synopsis Application

## Overview

This project is a video synopsis application that detects and tracks objects in a video, segments periods of activity, clusters similar events, and generates a summarized video. The goal is to condense lengthy surveillance footage into a short, informative video that highlights key events.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Detects objects in the video using motion detection algorithms.
- **Object Tracking**: Tracks detected objects across frames using robust tracking algorithms.
- **Temporal Segmentation**: Identifies and segments periods of significant activity in the video.
- **Event Clustering**: Groups similar events together to avoid redundancy.
- **Summary Generation**: Generates a concise video synopsis by stitching together key segments.
